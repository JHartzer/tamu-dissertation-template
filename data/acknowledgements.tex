\chapter*{ACKNOWLEDGMENTS}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{ACKNOWLEDGMENTS}  % Needs to be set to part, so the TOC doesnt add 'CHAPTER ' prefix in the TOC.


\indent This section is also optional, and limited to four pages. It must follow the Dedication Page (or Abstract, if there's no Dedication). If listing preliminary pages in Table of Contents, include Acknowledgments. This heading (\MakeUppercase{Acknowledgments}) is bold if major headings are bold. It should be in same type size and style as text. As does the vertical spacing, paragraph style, and margins. 

I would like to thank the Texas A\&M University Graduate and Professional School to allow me to construct this \LaTeX\ thesis template.  % use A\&M instead of A$\&$M, not use $A\&M$ as well, the last one won't be bold.
