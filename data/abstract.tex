(\emph{This \LaTeX ~ template applies double space for this ABSTRACT.}) The margin settings and text alignment should be consistent throughout the document. There should be no numbered references or formal citations in ABSTRACT.

The content of this ABSTRACT provides a complete, short snapshot of the research, addressing the purpose, methods, results, and conclusions of the document. As a result, it should stand alone without any formal citations or references to chapters/sections of the work.
